        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulmona" target="_blank"
            >Sulmona</a
        >, a nice little city near L'Aquila, in Abruzzo, Italy. I'm originally
        from a small town called

    <h2 class="text-title">To the PHP and beyond!</h2>
    <p>
        I've been doing PHP since my early years in school (2006); but since you
        should <strong>never stop learning</strong>, from february 2020 I joined
        a company called
        <a href="https://larus-ba.it" arget="_blank">Larus BA</a>
        where I started working with JVM based languages (Java, Scala, Kotlin)
        and also increased my knowledge in Javascript, expecially React. We also
        work with Apache Spark and Neo4j.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a big fan of testing and automation. I once was a coverage nazi, but
        I'm too old for that. Still a topic I'm really interested in.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-title">Not just work</h2>
    <p>
        Luckly I can have some free time, in which I like to play drums, hiking,
        and reading; mainly novels by my favorite writers are
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Palahniuk" target="_blank"
            >Chuck Palahniuk</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauro_Corona" target="_blank"
            >Mauro Corona</a
        >, but I'm not limited to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        When possible, together with my girlfriend Annalisa, we go for a trip.
        We recently have been to Istambul and Marrakech.
