<h2 class="text-title">To the PHP and beyond!</h2>
<p>
    I've been doing PHP since my early years in school (2006); but since you
    should <strong>never stop learning</strong>, from february 2020 I joined a
    company called
    <a href="https://larus-ba.it" data-log="link|larus" target="_blank"
        >Larus BA</a
    >
    where I started working with JVM based languages (Java, Scala, Kotlin) and
    also increased my knowledge in Javascript, expecially React. We also work
    with Apache Spark and Neo4j.
</p>
<p>
    I'm a big fan of testing and automation. I once was a coverage nazi, but I'm
    too old for that. Still a topic I'm really interested in.
</p>

<h2 class="text-title">Not just work</h2>
<p>
    Luckly I can have some free time, in which I like to play drums, hiking, and
    reading; mainly novels by my favorite writers are

        >Chuck Palahniuk</a

    and

        data-log="link|mauro_corona"
        target="_blank"
        >Mauro Corona</a
    >, but I'm not limited to them.
</p>
<p>
    When possible, together with my girlfriend Annalisa, we go for a trip. We
    recently have been to Istambul and Marrakech.

    I'd hopefully turn this into a blog sooner or later. If you want to keep in
