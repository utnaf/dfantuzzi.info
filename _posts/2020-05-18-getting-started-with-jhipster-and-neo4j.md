title: "Getting started with JHipster and Neo4j"
---

I wrote an article on Medium about these two tools, you can read it on [Medium](https://medium.com/larus-team/getting-started-with-jhipster-and-neo4j-35c8a647a6fe).

The article has been shared on Twitter by [Michael Simons](http://twitter.com/rotnroll666), main contributor for the [Neo4j side of JHipster](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/11226).
